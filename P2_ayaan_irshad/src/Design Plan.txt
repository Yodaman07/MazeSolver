Design Plan
Due: 3/12/2025

Create a list of to-dos or list of steps you believe you will have to
follow in order to solve this problem or to get started with it



1) Rename the project and commit and push as initial commit and push
2) Read the spec
3) Understand map-based input files!
3.5a) Create a couple of map-based input files for testing and understanding
3.5b) Create a couple of coordinate based input files.
4) Understand coordinate-based input files
5) Identify classes I should have for this project
6) Plan out file input
7) What data structure(s) will be needed? - Plan out any helper methods
	relevant to the problem.
	I want to use recursion for the first 2 approaches to check through the possible locations that have not been visited yet
8) Figure out the difference between stack based approach vs queue based
	approach
9) Understand why the 2 approaches generate different paths
10) What do the paths look like for the 2 approaches? Are they predictable?
10.5)How do I format the maze so that it is easily readable
11) Begin programming the stack approach for map based and coordinate inputs
11a) Make sure I can return both outputs
12) Begin programming the queue approach for map based and coordinate inputs
12a) Make sure I can return both outputs
13) Begin on the optimal path for both inputs
13a) Make sure I can return both outputs
14) Calculate runtime
15) Add cmd line arguments 


Remember this plan can change
