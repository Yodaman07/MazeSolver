Design Plan
Due: 3/12/2025

Create a list of to-dos or list of steps you believe you will have to
follow in order to solve this problem or to get started with it



1) Rename the project and commit and push as initial commit and push
2) Read the spec
3) Understand map-based input files!
3.5a) Create a couple of map-based input files for testing and understanding
3.5b) Create a couple of coordinate based input files.
4) Understand coordinate-based input files
5) Identify classes I should have for this project
6) Plan out file input
7) What data structure(s) will be needed? - Plan out any helper methods
	relevant to the problem.
	I want to use recursion for the first 2 approaches to check through the possible locations that have not been visited yet
8) Figure out the difference between stack based approach vs queue based
	approach
9) Understand why the 2 approaches generate different paths
10) What do the paths look like for the 2 approaches? Are they predictable?

11) How do I read maps vs coordinate based files. When loading, can I convert them into the  
same datatype - 2D char array so that the searching algs don't need to change too much for each input  
12) Begin programming the queue approach
13) Begin programming the stack approach

//WHERE I AM NOW
15) How do I print out the output and have it differ for the coordinate vs map inputs (converting from 2D array to each output)
 
14) Begin on the optimal path approach
16) Calculate runtime
17) Add cmd line arguments 


Remember this plan can change
